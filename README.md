# JavaDoc-Code-Generator

This program takes the java platform classes (packages java.*) and writes the definitions of all the classes,
methods, constructors, enums, and interfaces, and writes the corresponding java source files for it.
Note that all methods will be empty.

This program has a basic javaFX UI to show the progress.
